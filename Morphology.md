# Nouns

All nouns in <span id="Occultlang/Overview.md/language"/>LANGUAGE<span type="end"/> are constructed by prefixing a verbal root with one of several class prefixes. Every noun class may be animate or inanimate, which impacts its functional capacities.

Inanimate nouns cannot:
* Act as a possessor
* Precede an animate noun in a sentence

The table below describes each noun class and provides an example member.

| Class      | Description                                           | Prefix      | Example   | Gloss         |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :-------- | :------------ |
| Domain     | places, sources; dens; may be literal or metaphorical | `muh > moh` | `moːjä`   | unseen world  |
| Structure  | contours; boundaries and other limitations; shapes    | `neʔ`       | `nemäq`   | land, terrain |
| Collection | groups; individual elements functioning as a whole    | `seh`       | `seläjeh` | cosmos        |
Multiple nouns can be combined into a compound noun, creating novel meaning. For example, `mätä` and `mäwäh` refer to the habitats of *flora* and *fauna* respectively. The compound `mätämäwäh`, however, refers to the habitat of all living things and is often translated as *wilderness*.

It's notable that `mätämäwäh` intentionally excludes *funga*, who instead belong to *the unseen world*, `mäjä`, rather than `mätämäwäh`.
