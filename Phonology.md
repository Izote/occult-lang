# Overview

The <span id="Occultlang/README.md/language"/>LANGUAGE<span type="end"/> phonological inventory consists of 17 consonants, which includes a series of three ejectives: `tʼ`, `kʼ` and `qʼ`, along with 3 vowels. Vowel backness is an important distinguishing feature in this sound system covered in a subsequent section. 

The maximal standard syllable is `CV(C)` where the lateral approximant *l* can serve as a syllabic nucleus in place of a vowel. In this specific context, often referred to as an *l-syllable*, another *l* may not appear in either the onset nor coda positions.

# Phonotactics

## Vowel lowering

The vowel `u` lowers to `o` when adjacent to any pharyngeal, glottal or ejective consonant and is (often) denoted with an `A > B` transcription, where `A` precludes lowering and `B` includes it. This rule can be represented as:

$/u/ \rightarrow [o] \bigg/ \_\_\begin{bmatrix}pharyngeal&glottal&ejective\end{bmatrix}$.
## Vowel Harmony

Words are subject to vowel harmony in <span id="Occultlang/README.md/language"/>LANGUAGE<span type="end"/> such that front and back vowels may not co-exist in the same word context. Whether a word context is "back" or "front" dominant is determined by the very first such sound appearing in sequence:  `u` will become `e` in a "front" dominant word (and vice versa in a "back" dominant context). 

Wherever a shift from `e` to `u` would subject the vowel to lowering, `e`  shifts to `o` accordingly.
